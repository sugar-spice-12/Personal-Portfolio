# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! 
This space highlights a curated collection of my projects in AI, web development, machine learning, and hydropower systems engineering.

## Featured Projects

### Hydraulic Transient Analysis Model
An AI-integrated CFD model to predict and mitigate water hammer effects in hydropower systems. Includes 3D simulations using ANSYS & SimScale, with real-time monitoring via a React app.

### AI Therapy App
A mental health support app using a custom chatbot built with Hugging Face, Langchain, and React Native. Includes additional modules like music, yoga, laughter, and doctor consultations.

### AI-Based Generative Design for Hydropower
A data-driven system that automates hydro plant design using generative algorithms (GANs) and 3D modeling. Built using Python, Power BI, MATLAB, and GIS.
